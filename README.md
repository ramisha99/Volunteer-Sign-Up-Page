# Volunteer-Sign-Up-Page
A simple web page that gives information about the Cognitive Science Club fair event where you can work as a volunteer. 
At the bottom of the page includes a sign up form that interested individuals can use to sign up to participate. 
To encourage participation the page will also display the names of people who have already signed up to participate.
